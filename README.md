Online Retail Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)
## Project Overview

This project performs customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis on online retail transaction data. The goal is to understand customer purchasing behaviour, identify high-value customers, and produce actionable segments that can support marketing and retention strategies.

The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow:

1 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

2 Data cleaning and preparation

3 RFM metric construction and segmentation

4 Visualisation and business interpretation

5 Export of analytical outputs for BI consumption

6 Interactive dashboard built in Power BI

## Dataset

Source: Online Retail transactional dataset

File: Online_Retail.csv

Time period: December 2010 – December 2011

Unit of analysis (raw): One product line within an invoice

Key fields include:

InvoiceNo

InvoiceDate

CustomerID

Quantity

UnitPrice

Country

## Data Cleaning Rules

- To ensure the dataset represents valid customer purchases, the following rules were applied:

- Removed returns and cancellations (Quantity ≤ 0)

- Removed zero or negative prices (UnitPrice ≤ 0)

- Dropped transactions without CustomerID

- Created revenue explicitly:
Revenue = Quantity × UnitPrice

After cleaning, the dataset represents valid customer purchase events.

## RFM Methodology

RFM metrics were calculated at customer level:

Recency: Days since the customer’s most recent purchase

Frequency: Number of unique invoices per customer

Monetary: Total revenue generated by the customer

A snapshot date was defined as one day after the last transaction to calculate recency.

## Scoring

- Each R, F, and M metric was scored using quintiles (1–5)

- Higher scores indicate more desirable behaviour

- Scores were combined into a three-digit RFM code (e.g. 555)

## Segments

Customers were grouped into interpretable segments:

- Champions

- Loyal

- Recent

- Frequent

- High Value

- Others

## Key Insights

A small subset of customers (“Champions” and “Loyal”) contributes a disproportionate share of total revenue

Many customers purchase infrequently, indicating significant retention opportunity

High-value but inactive customers represent churn risk

RFM segmentation enables targeted marketing strategies rather than one-size-fits-all approaches

## Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built using the exported RFM dataset.

Dashboard features:

- KPI cards (customers, revenue, average recency)

- Customer count by segment

- Revenue contribution by segment

- RFM behavioural scatter plot

- Segment slicer for interactive filtering

The dashboard clearly links customer behaviour to revenue impact.
